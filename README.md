>[Apogee Digital Media Partners](https://www.apogeedigital.media) was conceived of by a passionate group of ad tech professionals determined to create a new programmatic advertising dogma. With over 20 years of combined experience spanning both sides of the ad tech ecosystem, we have recognized the need for an alternative to the bloated, black-box programmatic solutions available in the market today.

### Project Summary:

I worked with Apogee for about one month. The training data they provided to me was one month of interactions from one client's account. The general goal was to see if I could come up with any rules they could add to their business logic to improve the profitability of the ads they run. This could be done with a higher conversion rate, lowering costs, or increasing the profitability of the conversions that happen (a conversion being a sale or account creation, a user being a member of the public that saw the client's ad). I worked with the team at Apogee to narrow down the scope to a specific projects listed below. Throughout the project, I tried to stick with techniques that are interpretable and scalable so I would be able to translate my results to new business rules and test against the full dataset, if applicable. The training data I recieved was about 1.5 GB. The full dataset for this client is over 400 GB.


[Clustering Project](https://github.com/AmeliaMaier/Capstone_Machine_Learning_Apogee/blob/master/ClusteringREADME.md)

Via user clustering, what types of content show the highest intent for our client's
product/service? Our hypothesis is that content browsed by individual users provides indication of intent for our client's
product/service. 

[EDA Project](https://github.com/AmeliaMaier/Capstone_Machine_Learning_Apogee/blob/master/edaREADME.md)

Using standard exploritory data analysis, see if I can find areas of high or low profitability that can be leveraged by Apogee. Time permitting, create reusable scripts with json config files so they can rerun the analysis on more data.

[Network Mapping Project](https://github.com/AmeliaMaier/Capstone_Machine_Learning_Apogee/blob/master/NetworkGraphingREADME.md)

Analyze existing data to determine if the associative rule holds true for this application. Create a web crawler that will
perform a breadth first search for links on sites users have been seen at and map possible browsing routes from those starting points.


### Proprietary Information Concerns:

For security purposes, no data or data cleaning code will be included online unless all propriety information has been removed from it. This includes, but is not limited to: column names, user ids, actual costs or revenue.
