>[Apogee Digital Media Partners](https://www.apogeedigital.media) was conceived of by a passionate group of ad tech professionals determined to create a new programmatic advertising dogma. With over 20 years of combined experience spanning both sides of the ad tech ecosystem, we have recognized the need for an alternative to the bloated, black-box programmatic solutions available in the market today.

### Project Summary:

I worked with Apogee on a dataset for one client over one month. The general goal was to see if I could come up with any rules they could add to their business logic to improve the conversion rate of users. (a conversion being a sale or account creation, a user being a member of the public that saw the client's ad) I worked with the team at Apogee to narrow down the scope to a specific hypothesis listed below. For security purposes, no data or data cleaning code will be included online.

### Hypothesis:

Our hypothesis is that content browsed by individual users provides indication of intent for our client's
product/service. Via user clustering, what types of content show the highest intent for our client's
product/service?
