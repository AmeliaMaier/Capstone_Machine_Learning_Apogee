>[Apogee Digital Media Partners](https://www.apogeedigital.media) was conceived of by a passionate group of ad tech professionals determined to create a new programmatic advertising dogma. With over 20 years of combined experience spanning both sides of the ad tech ecosystem, we have recognized the need for an alternative to the bloated, black-box programmatic solutions available in the market today.

### Project Summary:

I worked with Apogee on a dataset for one client over about one month. The general goal was to see if I could come up with any rules they could add to their business logic to improve the profitability of the ads they run. This could be done with a higher conversion rate, lowering costs, or increasing the profitability of the conversions that happen.(a conversion being a sale or account creation, a user being a member of the public that saw the client's ad) I worked with the team at Apogee to narrow down the scope to a specific projects listed below. For security purposes, no data or data cleaning code will be included online. Throughout the project, I tried to stick with techniques that are interpretable and scalable so I would be able to translate my results to new business rules and test against their full dataset, if applicable. The training data I recieved was about 1.5 GB. The full dataset for this client is over 400 GB.


[Clustering Project](https://github.com/AmeliaMaier/Capstone_Machine_Learning_Apogee/blob/master/ClusteringREADME.md)

Via user clustering, what types of content show the highest intent for our client's
product/service? Our hypothesis is that content browsed by individual users provides indication of intent for our client's
product/service.
